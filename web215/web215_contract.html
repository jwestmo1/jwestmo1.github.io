		<h2>Contract</h2>
		<p>I, <a href="introduction.html" style="text-decoration:none">Jen C. Westmoreland</a>, agree to abide by the terms in my Spring WEB215 Adv Markup and Scripting with my instructor, Professor D.I. von Briesen.</p>
		<p>I understand that all work that I do on my school and personal websites will be publicly available to the world. I will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.</p>
		<p>I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as an absence.</p>

		<p>Signed: <span class="signature">Jen C. Westmoreland</span>, 15 January 2022</p>
