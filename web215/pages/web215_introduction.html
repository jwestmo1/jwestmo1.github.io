		<h2>Introduction</h2>

		<ul>
			<li><strong>Personal Background:</strong> I am originally from Virginia and will always call it home, even though I have been in North Carolina for more than 20 years
				now. I also took a detour to Texas for a few years and I miss that state. I have two kids, who are absolutely awesome! I love being outdoors, and am always up for
				an adventure.</li>
			<li><strong>Professional Background:</strong> I currently have three jobs, two of which are working for non-profits. The US one I am the HR rep, the executive
				administrator, as well as anything else they throw my way. My non-profit job I am the CEO that helps people in India. (Ask me about it, I LOVE to talk about India.)
				My third job is working as admin for a tree cutting company.</li>
			<li><strong>Academic Background:</strong> Long and varied with a huge break in between the academic four walls. I attended college in NC, learned telecommunications
				and worked in that for many years, before jumping into homeschooling (which means relearning everything for a second and third time), and I am now back to school to
				learn more about my COVID interest.</li>
			<li><strong>Primary Computer Platform:</strong> Windows 10</li>
			<li><strong>Courses I'm Taking, and Why:</strong>
				<ol>
					<li><strong>CSC121 - Python - </strong>I enjoyed it so much last semester that I am basically taking the same class this semester.</li>
					<li><strong>CTS240 - Project Management - </strong>I need to learn how to boss people around.</li>
					<li><strong>WEB115 - Web Markup and Scripting - </strong>I am taking this because Professor von Briesen is teaching it! <a href="https://jwestmo1.github.io/web115/web115_contract.html">Contract</a></li>

				</ol>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Something to Remember Me By:</strong> I believe that learning doesn't just happen in the classroom, but sometimes you need that too.</li>
