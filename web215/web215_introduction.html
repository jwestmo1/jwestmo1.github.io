		<ul>
			<li><strong>Personal Background:</strong> I am originally from Virginia and will always call it home, even though I have been in North Carolina for more than 20 years
				now. I also took a detour to Texas for a few years and I miss that state. I have two kids, who are absolutely awesome! I love being outdoors, and am always up for
				an adventure.</li>
			<li><strong>Professional Background:</strong> I currently have three jobs, two of which are working for non-profits. The US one I am the HR rep, the executive
				administrator, as well as anything else they throw my way. My non-profit job I am the CEO that helps people in India. (Ask me about it, I LOVE to talk about India.)
				My third job is working as an admin for a tree cutting company.</li>
			<li><strong>Academic Background:</strong> Long and varied with a huge break in between the academic four walls. I attended college in NC, learned telecommunications
				and worked in that for many years, before jumping into homeschooling (which means relearning everything for a second and third time), and I am now back to school to
				learn more about my COVID interest.</li>
				<li><strong>Background in this Subject:</strong>This is my fourth and fifth class with Professor VonBriesen, so that should make me an expert right?
					 I used to love to code when I was a kid and I have always had a love/knack for computers.  That’s actually how I got my first job as a manager.
					 Studying at CPCC has really made everything come full circle.</li>
			<li><strong>Primary Computer Platform:</strong> Windows 10</li>
			<li><strong>Courses I'm Taking, and Why:</strong>

					<li><strong>CSC221-N801: Advanced Python - </strong>This finishes out my Full Stack degree.</li>
					<li><strong>WEB215-N801: Adv Markup and Scripting - </strong>This finishes out my Web design degree.  <a href="https://jwestmo1.github.io/web215/web215_contract.html"> Contract</a></li>
					<li><strong>WEB250-N801: Database Driven Websites - </strong>This finishes out my Web design degree.</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Funny/Interesting Item About Yourself: </strong>I love web design, but my other main interest is woodworking.  I have a she shed bigger than most people’s garages full of woodworking equipment.</li>
			<li><strong>I'd Also Like to Share: </strong> I love to take pictures of sunrises and sunsets.  It calms my soul.</li>
