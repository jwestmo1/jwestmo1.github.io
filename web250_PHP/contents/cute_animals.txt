echidna10.jpg|| Echidna|| You’ll have to be quick with the camera – echidnas don’t stop to say ‘cheese’! With powerful digging claws,they’ll be underground within just a few moments. ||Echidnas are monotremes, or egg-laying mammals. So, just as you thought they couldn’t get much stranger with their ant-eating snout, bristling spikes and spurs. 
dingo9.jpg|| Dingo|| Dingoes are the only canine that's native to Australia, despite researchers not knowing the exact timing of their first arrival to the continent. Once found across most of mainland Australia, there aren't many purebred dingoes left in the wild. || One of the best places for seeing them in their natural environment is on beautiful Fraser Island. 
sea-turtles8.jpg|| Sea Turtle|| We love sea turtles so much! They're some of the greatest travellers of the animal kingdom, regularly cruising up and down the East Coast. Every year hundreds of turtle hatchlings make their way from the beach to the ocean – a truly once-in-a-lifetime experience to witness! || One of the best places to watch the magic is in Bundaberg.  
kangaroo7.jpg|| Kangaroo|| If you've made it this far and can't believe there are animals even cuter than kangaroos, buckle up! But seriously though, just look at that little face and those little arms and those jumpy legs. J'adore.  ||Get up close and personal with both red and grey kangaroos in the aptly-named Roo Heaven at Australia Zoo, where you can hand-feed them and take a cheeky selfie (or three). 
platypus6.jpg|| Platypus|| They've got the bill of a duck, the tail of a beaver, the fur of an otter and webbed feet to boot (plus venomous spurs on the males!) – and did we mention they're egg-laying mammals? || Platypus are super shy and often stay hidden beneath the surface of the water or burrowed deep into riverbanks, but they're well worth patiently waiting for a quick glimpse because they are just so cute! 
sea-lion5.jpg|| Sea Lion|| The puppers of the sea! Australian sea lions are super cute and a must-see around the coastal southern regions. We recommend taking a trip to Kangaroo Island to see one of the largest sea lion colonies in Australia. || Did you know you can tell the difference between sea lions and seals by their ears? Sea lions' are visible!
sugar-glider4.jpg|| Sugar Glider|| Can we get a collective ‘Awwwww’? Sugar Gliders are social, pint-sized, insect lovin’ marsupials, with one super cool talent: they can fly! (Well, not really, but the gliding tactic is a pretty cool way to avoid conflict with a would-be predator.) || Unfortunately, sugar gliders are highly prized by poachers but we think these guys are just gorgeous when left in the wild where they belong, don’t you think?
wombat3.jpg|| Wombat|| It must take a heart of stone not to melt at the sight of the waddling amble of our sturdy Australian pal, the wombat. Wombats are herbivorous marsupials, digging out complicated burrow systems in heavily vegetated areas. || You’re unlikely to see one in the wild, but if you’re still keen make acquaintance, many Australian wildlife parks have a resident wombat you can admire.
koala2.jpg|| Koala|| Australia’s most celebrated gum leaf-loving tree-hugger, the koala. We’re not sure whether it’s that coal black button nose or the fact that this guy seems to be in cuddle-mode forever – we just know that visitors to Australia will do anything to get a closer look! Australia’s very own living soft toy is not so well known for its aggressive and territorial habits, so be warned! || Wild koalas do not like to be touched, and their strong gripping claws can cause serious damage to those offering unwanted attention!
quokka1.jpg|| Quokka|| World-famous for their adorable little smiles and willingness to jump into a selfie with tourists, quokkas are another pouched marsupial native to Australia. || Wild quokkas are only found on Rottnest Island off the coast of Perth in Western Australia, but if you're not planning a trip out there you can see them in some zoos and wildlife sanctuaries.
